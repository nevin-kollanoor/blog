- For Success like happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. And it only does so as an unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as a byproduct of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself
- There are things that must cause you to leave your reason. Or you have none to lose. 
- Between stimulus and response there is a space.  In that space is our power to choose our response.  In our response lies our growth and our freedom
- So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!
- What is to give light must endure burning.
- The one thing you can’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one’s freedoms is to choose one’s attitude in any given circumstance
- He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How
- The meaning of life is unique to each individual and each moment. Asking the meaning of life as a generic question is same as asking a chess master what is the bet move in the world
- Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.

Existential Vacuum

- A common complaint of today is the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of their lives. The lack of awareness of a meaning worth living for. This experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves is what's referred as existential vacuum.
- The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom.  Boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. 
- people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning
- This existential void sometimes manifests into some of our primitive traits like gluttony or increase in sexual drive
