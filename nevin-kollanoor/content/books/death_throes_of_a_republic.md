## Ep 1. The Gracchi Brothers

- The wars which elevate Rome to superpower status also sow the seed for the downfall of its political system. Money, slaves, ambition, political stalemate and class warfare prove to be a toxic, bloody mix
- The Republic came into existence from 509 BC and ended in 27 BC
- Roman society is kind of organised like a Mafia family.
- Rome saw crazy transformation in just a generation or two (Just like the US before and after World wars), with wealth brought in by the wars they fought - 
	- The three punic wars fought between Carthaginians (modern Tunisia) and Romans between 264 BC and 142 BC
	- Macedonian wars between Romans and Greek allies (importantly Seleucid empire) between 214 BC and 148 BC
- Patrician class was top of the food chain in Rome. They ruled over people like Gods.
- Tribune of Plebs were created (494 BC) to protect the interests of plebeians against the senate and magistrates, who were exclusively Patricians. This happened coz patricians needed plebeians to fight wars for them
- There were 300 aristocratic senators in the senate
- Tribunes (10 in number) while in their power are completely protected in Rome. But their security is void when they step out of Rome or when their term ends
- The Problem:
	- In the last hundred years, there had been several wars. Since legionaries were required to serve in a complete campaign, no matter how long it was, soldiers often left their farms in the hands of wives and children. Small farms in this situation often went bankrupt and were bought up by the wealthy
- Tiberius Gracchus(166-133 BC), born to a wealthy influential family had an epiphany while travelling through he country side of Italy, 
    > *The beasts of the field and birds of the air have their holes and hiding places, but the men who fight and die for Italy only enjoy the light and air. Our  generals urge their soldiers to fight for the graves and shrines of their ancestors. You have no ancestral tomb. You fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others. You are called the masters of the world, but you do not have a foot of ground that you can call your own*
- Tiberius became a Tribune by promising agrarian reforms that would stop the problem
- The Senate accusing him to having intentions to become the King, killed him brutally by beating him to death - by evoking something like Martial law - when he was trying to run for a 2nd term (running for 2nd term never happened in 200 years)
- Gaius Gracchus (154-121 BC) , Tiberius’ brother, also suffered the same fate when he tried to implement the same. This time the Senate defeated him by lobbying a Tribune who offered people more than what Gaius promised which eventually resulted in him being not elected to as a Tribune again
- After Gauis left the office, Senate repealed all the agrarian reforms and had him killed
- Gracchi brothers were referred to as traitors of their class just like the Roosevelt brothers
    > *Democracy doesn’t tend to survive extreme faction, fear mongering and subverting the needs of the state to what ever is politically expedient at that moment*
- Less than a century after the Gracchi fall, so does the republic

## Ep 2. Gauis Marius

> *"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable” - JFK*
- Gaius Marius (157 BC - 86 BC) is a people’s person. He would rather have a beer with the boys than sit through a Greek play. Elites would consider him ill-mannered
- He is known for killing a Barbarian king in mano-o-mano encounter
- He was endorsed by Scipio Aemilianus who played a key role in Third Punic war (149-146 BC) by saying *"Perhaps this is the man”* as his worthy successor
- *Trivia:* In 130s ballots replaced the oral voting
- Numidia was an ally of Rome in Third Punic war. It broke into a civil war (~118 BC) when Jugurtha declared open war against his 2 cousins after a fallout about throne.
- Rome when it tried to go against Jugurtha and bring peace, it got defeated over and over again by Jurgurtha’s guerilla type fighting tactics
- Marius gets consulship by promising Senate that he will bring Jugurtha back in chains or kill him with his own hands
- Marius then waived the requirement for a soldier to have land and promised wealth and land if they fight for him and win
- So the allegiance of these poor turned to the generals rather than the state
- So being a soldier and fighting war has become a career as opposed to an institutional memory as these soldiers now have no land to go back to
- Rome eventually wins Jugurthine war and Marius takes on full credit even though a young general named Lucious Cornelius Sulla deserved a lot of that credit
- Couple of Barbaric tribes (Germanic and Celtic), Cimbri and Teutones, previously unknown to Romans start attacking the Republic from the north almost at the same time as the Jugurtha war. Cimbric war (113–101 BC)
- These tribes prove to be one of the toughest opponents Roman faced till that date. This calls for Marius to take command with his Marius’ mules.
- Roman army defeats the Teutones and then the Cimbri, all the time Marius being elected to consulship over and over again. Marius again overshadows the Sulla’s achievements in the war
- Grateful people donated large portions of the immense spoils to him making him fabulously wealthy - wealthy enough to own a kingdom of his own.
    > *“To the Gods and Marius”*
- Now it’s Marius’ turn to hold up his end with the volunteer army. He aligns with Saturninus to get the required land and wealth for his army from the state
- Saturnines realizes how powerful Tribune of plebs can be if one were to be astute. He soon forms a mafia, sets up his own goons and grows powerful. Fearing his rise Senate appealed to the then Consul....Marius
- Marius put a siege on Saturnines and his followers, who then agree to give up and agree to terms, and he locked them on Senate house over night to figure out what needs to be done.
- But an angry mob broke into the building, picked up the stone tiles from the roof and threw it down at Saturnines and his followers, lynching those inside.
- Now, Senate never liked Marius, and among his populares supporters Marius had, bunch of them got stoned with blame coming to Marius
- Marius resigns after 6th consulship virtually in disgrace (99 BC)

## Ep 3. Sulla vs Gaius

- **Marcus Livius Drusus (Jr.)** comes into the picture - a Roman politician who proposed citizenship to Italian allies during his tribuneship
- Death to tyrant is an always exciting theme in Roman republic
- Drusus was assassinated in 91 BCE at his home
- Drusus’ assassination triggered unrest among Italian allies who saw this as the last straw that gave them hopes of citizenship 
- ? What are the benefits of Roman citizenship?
- Italian Allies started exchanging hostages kind of like collateral to ensure everyone stays together on the revolt against Rome
- **Social war ensues!!! (91-88 BC)**
- Meanwhile...Mithridates from Pontus, the legend of poisoned king
- Mithridates, seeing the social war as an opportune moment, lit the fuse in making the Roman east and Greeks to rise up against Romans. He ordered execution of Roman generals in Asia Minor
- Given the dire situation regarding the social war cooking up around Rome and loss of control in Asia Minor Romans did the following which is very in Roman like - Concessions
- First they offered Roman citizenship to allied who are about to join the social war, then the same to regions who were financially struggling due to this social war and then eventually to all allies bringing the social war to an end
- And the general who championed this social war was **Lucious Cornelius Sulla**
- Sulla is supposed to have built his fortune on the wealth left to him by the Rome’s highest paid prostitute
- Sulla goes back and wins consulship (Remember Marius resigned from his 6th Consulship in 99 BC)
- Romans cheated Italian allies of their citizenship promise in fine print. They tweaked this intricate system by including Italian allies in election bodies that would never really impact the vote, kind of like today’s gerrymandering 
- **Sulpicious**, a tribune, now tries to champion the cause of these Italian allies
- He goes into a lot of debt, trying to gain support of lot of people in power and he is in need of a gravitas to support his cause. So he turns to this old figure, Marius
- Marius in return, doesn’t want the consulship, but wants to lead the conquest in the east with Mithridates. Possible reason is because that war is seen as an easy one with hyper wealth to be grabbed as spoils
- **When Sulla left Rome to fight the war, Sulpicious passed law putting Marius in charge** and championing few of the rights of Italian allies
- Now Sulla snapped when 2 riders came to his fortification and asked him to turnover his army informing him of the new law. Sulla has 35,000 legionaries at his disposal. 
- Remember how after Marius’ military reforms the allegiance of legionaries shifted from state to the general, well when Sulla told them the situation and asked them what shall we do, they said let’s smash Rome and restore what is taken from us
- **Sulla takes 5 of his 6 legions “To free her of her tyrants” 87 BCE**
- Marius arms whoever he could find in the city. Sulla still succeeds and enters the city with the legions. He repeals the power of Pleabeian Tribune to pass law. He puts up bounty on the heads of around 15 people which include Sulpicious and Marius
- Marius, despite being 70 and overweight manages to escape and finds solace somewhere in Carthage 
- Sulla, who never wanted to be a dictator but only the first among the equals left for East leaving Augustus and Cinna incharge 
- As soon as Sulla leaves, Cinna tried to reverse Sulla’s actions, unsuccessful at first, later forces it with the support of the sixth legion Sulla left behind. Marius sees this opportunity and set sail to Rome 
- Marius get’s his 7th Consulship, only to die 17 days into power due to health issues (86 BC)

![targets](/images/dtotr/sulla_1.png)

## Ep 4. Sulla returns with Legions and civil war ensues

- Cinna gets killed by legionaries he recruited from Italian allies in a mutiny (84 BC)
- Sulla finishes his war in east and come back to Rome on 83 BCE
- 3 years of civil war ensues
- Marius junior kills himself
- Two people joined Sulla’s cause - Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey. Pompey was only 23 but raised an army of his own from among his father's veterans 
- Sulla not only killed who supported Marian regime but also a few rich people. He had to pay all his troops who were working to kill these Italian allies who oppose Sulla
- Sulla has this proscription list which had names of people who are wanted dead and had a bounty on them. 
- Crasus and many made a fortune through these auctions of stuff belonging to rich people in prescribe list
- Pompei was dubbed by his opponents as the adolescent butcher
- Sulla saw a 26 year old as a future trouble maker and added him to the prescribe list. But upon insistence from his other generals he exempts that lad and says “But I’m warning you, in that man goes many a Marius”. That kid was **Gaius Julius Caesar**. 
- 5000 people die through this proscriptions
- Sulla reorganizes, declares himself as dictator being able to amend laws with no tenure limit
- Sulla passes laws that regulates the ambition of the Romans. The new edict requires that once a Roman becomes a Tribune of plebs, he cannot hold any other office again and passed age restrictions on different offices. He limited veto power of Tribunes, required a 10 year cool off period for a person to hold the same office again
- He increased courts for faster trials. 
- He disbanded his legions, retired from dictatorship in 2 years by restoring consulship in 80 BCE
- He died of intestinal hemorrhage in 78 BCE
- “No friend ever served me and no enemy ever wronged whom I’ve not repaid in full” -Sulla
- What Sulla really might have  ended up teaching is the new rules of the Roman game of power and ambition was that there were no rules

## Ep 5. Introducing Caesar

- Rome didn’t have a written constitution. Do anything that happens often enough is by precedent constitutional
- ?Read about gladiator Spartacus who led the slave revolt in 71 BCE
- Marcus Crassus comes into the picture when third survival war happens. Other generals didn’t want to command this war as this task was looked down upon. There isn’t much to gain
- Crassus killed 6000 slaves who survived the revolt, and crucified them on the busiest highway to Rome
- Crasus and Pompei join hands to force senate to appoint them as consuls. 

Cato enters the scene

- Gaius Julius Caesar was a charming person. He always stayed groomed. He was a fashion icon. His baldness is the only thing his enemies could harp on.
- Caesar slept around with wives and sisters of his influential people. 
- Caesar is married to Cinna’s daughter. When Sulla asked him to divorce his wife, he asked him to fuck off 
- When Caesar left Italy sometime after Sulla died, he got captured by pirates. He reproached them when asked only for 20 talents (1 talent = ~30 kg). He volunteered to give them 50, sent his servants to get the ransom and spent time writing poems. After being freed, he gathered troops, chased these pirates and crucified them
- Pompey left to champion the problem of seemingly unwieldy growth of pirates in Mediterranean 
- Economic situation in Rome was not looking great in 60s BCE. Contributing to this situation were the slave revolts civil war when Sulla returned and a large number of people who couldn’t make ends meet started congregating at Rome as there was free food. State at this point was counting on Pompey to win the war with Pirates and Mithredeitis and being loot back home
- Cataline conspiracy (63 BC) - was a plot devised by Catalina with the help of few aristocrats and veterans of Sulla, to overthrow consulship of Cicero and Hybrida

## Ep 6. Beginning of the End

- Festival for women happens at Pontificus Maximus Residence. Publix’s Claudius crashes the party 
- Julius Caesar is Pontificus Maximus
- Cool kids all imitating Caesar. Caesar and Claudius are considered darlings of smart set
- Rome has no police force. Actual physical control of the forum when votes were happening can prove vital
- Caesar divorces his wife and goes as a witness for the trial against Claudius
- Many Goateed young bloods flooded the forum during Claudius’ trial. Note Cicero’s remarks on these people who flooded the forum
- Caesar, in an effort to save his face says he wasn’t there hence doesn’t know anything about what happened. When the inquisitor asks him why he divorced his wife he said “Because wife of Caesar must be above suspicion”
- Cicero goes up to stand and testify against Claudius’ alibi that he wasn’t in town that day
- Claudius gets acquitted and Cicero makes an enemy
- Immediately after this Caesar leaves Rome to attend to a job he managed to get in Spain. But when the people whom he owed didn’t let him leave, he took money from Crasus and paid them. 
- During this same time, 61 BC, Pompei returns from his war with Pirates and Methredeitis. With the money he brought in, he eliminated the fiscal crisis Rome had been having for 10 years. 

***Trivia:*** When Pompei returned with wealth equivalent to support 2 million people for an year, with his fancy Alexander’s cloak he got from Methreditis, he had a slave stand beside him and whisper periodically “You are just a mortal”

* Pompei faces resistance from senate to get a few things done - land for his legionaries, approval of the trade processes put in place in the east. Cato, Cicero and Luculus all are not cooperating with Pompei
* In 60 BC, Caesar comes back from Spain with a lot of money (how did he make that money?). Senate announces a Triumph for his achievements - which is very coveted and Pompei had that thrice btw. He arrives at the gates just a day prior to the deadline for Consul nomination. When he requests senate to let a proxy stand in his place so that he can wait out the required one day to arrange the triumphs, Cato intervened and tried to filibuster the senate meeting. Caesar said fuck it, gave up the triumph and came in and put his nomination 
* Caesar reaches out to Pompei and Crassus and pitched that by weakening each other’s influence they are promoting the interests of Cicero, Cato etc. who would be nobody if they were united
* Thus they formed the 1st Triumvarate. Now with their  money, influence and access to ruthless military force they could control election results and bypass Senate. This signaled the bankruptcy of old order. This many people regard as the first viable event that can be credited with the end of Roman republic. Pompei, at 46, is only 6 years older than Caesar. Caesar weds his daughter Julia to Pompei 😂
* There was an anti Darwinism going on with Senate by then. Whenever someone with caliber and with the capacity to influence and stand ground graced the Senate, they were purged at some point by coup or internal politics. When Sulla disbanded a bunch of Senate, he repopulated then with sheep he can easily control. 
* Caesar wins the Consulship in 59 BC along with Calpernius Bibluous who is a Cato’s pawn btw. 
* Cicero and Cato continue to undermine the triumvarate in whatever ways they can. And in the meanwhile, a person of noble birth converts himself to a commoner - a ritual carried out by then Pontificus Maximus Julius Caesar. He did so to run for tribune of plebs. This person was none other than Claudius who seeks to take revenge on Cicero
* Claudius becomes the tribune. He brings up charges on Cicero on the fact that he executed people who were involved in Cataline conspiracy without trial. Cicero eventually breaks and exiled himself from Rome 
* Claudius the gang leader. He grows stronger and starts going after Pompei  Meanwhile Caesar is fighting Gauls
* Triumvarate realizes they’re need help to keep Claudius in check. They think Cicero is the man for the job and being him back to Rome
* Claudius continues to use his gang to deprive Pompei of any lucrative quests and sets them up to throw dung and stuff at him. 
* Seeing all this, Caesar calls for a meeting with Triumvarates and renews the agreement. He has been assured 5 more years of consulship. Crasus and Pompei were to run for consul. Crasus would be taking care of wars in Syria. And Pompei in Spain 
* Pompei is in mad love with his wife Julia. At 54 BC Julia dies giving birth to Pompei’s child. Soon Caesar’s mother dies. Crasus plans for war with Aparthians. ?Why was the tribune against this war?
* Crasus get deceived by the guide and gets left in the middle of the desert with his army (south eastern Turkey). A 10,000 strong aparthian army which almost all are cavalry, attack Crassus’ army. Crasus and his army meet their end that day (53 BCE)
* Meanwhile, gangs of Milo and gangs of Clodius clash in Roman streets. In one of those clashes, Clodius gets murdered in 52 BC
* Cloudius’ murder gave rise to civil unrest. With no police and military not allowed to enter the city, things are getting out of hand. Senate seeks help of Pompei’s veteran legionaries, who at that time was in Rome controlling his troops in Spain remotely, to provide protection during Milo’s trial
* Cicero was Milo’s lawyer - who is known for his great oratory skills performed sub par and Milo gets convicted and exiled. 
* This leaves Pompei very powerful. Cato lobbies to make Caesar abandon his legions. Caesar in the same time, using the money he is making through his conquests in Gaul, lobbies to make Pompei abandon his legions instead. This results in Senate eventually voting for both of them abandoning their legions simultaneously. And this time, rumour goes around that Caesar is marching to Rome with his legions. With this threat, Marcellus forces Senate to go to Pompei and request him to defend Rome using his legions.
* On Jan 1st 49 BC, Caesar’s representative in the Senate, Mark Antony, who is also a tribune, delivers the deal to the Senate that both of them will disband their legions and leave it to the public as to what has to be done. Senate denies the deal and said Caesar has to disband the army right away or will be declared an outlaw.
* Now Caesar marches towards Rome. Pompei scrambles to build an army in East - remember his army is in Spain. Caesar meanwhile goes to Spain and finishes his business with Pompei’s army. Caesar and his army gets trapped and Pompei’s army surrounds them. Now Pompei can peacefully play the war of attrition but upon pressure from his affluent senators, he plans the battle of Pharsalus in Aug 48 BCE. Pompei had majority in Cavalry (7k to 1k) and infantry (45k to 22k).
* Long story short - Pompei loses the war - he flees in disguise. He picks up his wife and goes to Egypt. But a Roman former legionary kills and decapitates him. When Caesar arrives in Egypt a month later, an Egyptian emissary presents the pickled Pompei’s head. Caesar was taken aback - Caesar would have rather preferred to forgive Pompei.
* The dynasty in power then - Ptolemy dynasty - was kind of like a disgrace for Roman empire. They married their siblings. Their kings were fat. Rome had great disrespect for Ptolemies. There’s a rivalry going on then between Ptolemy and his sister Cleopatra, aged around 21. Remember that Ptolemies were not Egyptians. They came from a the bloodline of a general from Alexander’s army. But Cleopatra was the first one in this line who could speak Egyptian.
* Caesar orders Ptolemy and Cleopatra to disband their army and come to him to resolve the dispute. Ptolemy doesn’t disband his army and Cleopatra cannot get to Caesar as she is behind enemy lines. Cleopatra does a magnificent entrance, by having someone roll her up on a carpet, smuggle her and unroll it infant of Caesar. That’s it Caesar is flattered 😍
* Learning this, teenage Ptolemy XIII sieges Caesar’s residence. Caesar gets trapped for months with Cleopatra - eventually reinforcements arrive. Ptomely drowns trying to swim across the Nile with his golden armour (47 BCE).
* After freeing from Egypt, he quickly goes to Asia Minor to settle any uprising that have happened in his absence of action. He has such a quick victory that during this period in a letter to Senate he writes Veni vidi vici - I came I saw I conquered. Caesar goes back to Rome with pregnant Cleopatra. 
* Meanwhile Pompei’s former legions congregate in North Africa and start training with the aid from Numidian king (Juba) and Cato. Caesar goes and starts fighting them. Caesar wins battle after battle. Eventually everyone either flees or commit suicide including Cato (46 BCE). Caesar goes back to Rome and makes himself dictator for the next 10 years. He throws himself a Triumph - bigger than the one Pompei got.
* He later goes to Spain to crush the armies raised by Pompei’s sons and Pompei’s former legionaries. Caesar in 44 BCE declares himself dictator for life.
* Caesar decides to go to fight Parthians - the ones Crassus died fighting. Caesar appoints 2 people incharge to preside while he were to be away.
* Caesar meets the Senate in theatre of Pompey. A blood pact was formed among a bunch to assassinate Caesar, and they do so. Everyone in the pact stabs Caesar - including Brutus - ***Et tu Brutus😭***. 23 wounds were inflicted upon him. Slaughter of few senators, foreigners and commoners ensued due to the breakdown of public order.
* Mark Antony was conferred with a political position for not going for vengeance and avoiding civil war. Antony read Caesar’s will and revealed that Caesar left most of his money to people and republic. The mood started shifting and then the funeral happened.
