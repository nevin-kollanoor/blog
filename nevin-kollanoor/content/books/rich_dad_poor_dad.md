Rich dad lessons:
1. Rich don’t work for money. Savers are losers 
2. Your house is not an asset
3. How the rich pay less taxes

### INTRODUCTION 
- I can’t afford it (vs) How can I afford it
	- I can’t afford it is a statement and it immediately shuts the brain down. How can I afford it asks a question. This small change keeps the brain engaged and align thoughts accordingly 
### CH1 - The rich don’t work for the money

### CH2 - Why teach Financial literacy 
- Buy Assets, not liabilities, and you’ll be rich
- The rich buy assets, the poor only have expenses, the middle class buy liabilities that they think are assets 
- Lack of financial literacy means wealth does not stay with you. Lottery winners often end up broke soon
- The 21st century illiterate is not the one who can’t read, but the one who can’t learn, unlearn and relearn
<cash flow pattern>
- Money without intelligence is money soon gone

### CH3 - Mind your own business
- Your profession is different from your business. If you work at HSBC, it means you are making money for HSBC’s business. You do not own a business
- Your business revolves around your asset, not your income. 
- Once a dollar goes into your asset, it becomes your employee. It works 24x7 and can work for generations 
- Acquire the type of assets you love. That way you will take better care of them and enjoy learning about them

### CH4-History of taxes:
- Taxes used to be temporary, often used to finance wars. 
- In 1874 England permanently levied income taxes 
- In 1913, with the 16th amendment, US made taxes permanent
- These taxes were accepted by majority because they were first levied only on the rich. Although it was designed to punish the rich, it ended up punishing the poor and the middle class
- But just because of how the incentives are aligned - where a private organization tries to save money and under cut budgets, a government body tries to exhaust its budgets and employ more people. Hence Government’s appetite for taxes kept increasing and the burden tripled down to middle class and poor too. 
- 
- Corporations pay their expenses before paying taxes
- Corporations: Earn->spend->pay taxes
- Employees: Earn->pay taxes->spend

### CH5 - The rich invent the money
- Often in the world is not the smart who get ahead but the bold
- Tier financial success requires both technical knowledge and courage

### Ch6 - Work to learn - Don’t work for money

### Ch7 - Overcoming obstacles 
- A very common form of laziness - avoiding something important by keeping busy
- Answer for this kind of laziness - a little bit of greed. 
- Greed is good. Guilt is worse than greed, for guilt Rob’s the body of its soul. 
- Do what you feel at your heart to be right, for your Will be criticized anyway. Dammed if you do, dammed if you don’t.
