### 1. Decoy Effect:

- Often people don't know what they want until these see things in context. Everything is relevant. 
- we are always looking at things in relation to others. A perceived size of circle changes based on whether it's placed among other smaller circles or bigger circles
- This is the reason why a print+online subscription is the best seller when you have a decoy option like print only for almost the same price
- We take the decision based on what we do know - print +online for 150$ is better than print only for 125$
- Introducing a new most expensive entree in a restaurant menu improves the sale of next most expensive entree
- "A man's satisfaction with his salary depends on whether he makes more than his wife's sister's husband"

### 2. Arbitrary Coherence:

- Second price auction?
- The first seen price in a new product category serves as an anchor - as long as you seriously contemplate to buy it. 
- This is same reason why people are initially not willing to pay higher rents when they move to expensive cities even when their wages are calibrated
- These anchors have an enduring affect and we see ourselves coming back to this anchor diet comparison

3. The cost of zero cost

- Zero is the source of emotional excitement 
- Every transaction has an upside and a downside. Free transactions gives the illusion that there‚Äôs bio downside. Our high inclination to loss aversion makes it far more attractive than it actually is
- Amazon saw an increase in AOV when it introduced free shipping above 20$. They saw this increase everywhere except in France where they charged a reduced fee of 20 cents for these high value orders
- Zero is not another discount, it‚Äôs a place. Difference between 2 and 1 is small. But the difference between 1 and zero is huge

### 4. Social and Market norms

- People might work more for a cause than cash
- There are 2 different worlds we live in. One where market norms apply and one where social norms apply
- Once social norm meets the market norm, social norm goes away for a long long time

### 5. Influence of arousal

- Our inability to understand ourselves doesn‚Äôt improve with experience 

### 6. Problem of procrastination and self control

- Resisting temptation and instilling self control are general human goals, and repeatedly failing to achieve them is the source of much of our misery
- Road to hell is paved with good intentions
- Pre commitment (self imposed challenge) is one tool that solves this

### 7. The high price of ownership 

- When we own something, we start to value it more than others 
- Students who won a lottery to a basketball game were willing to sell it at 2400$ while while students who didn‚Äôt make the lottery were willing to buy at only 170$
- We fall in love for what we already have
- In case of large transactions, approach it as if you are a non-owner

### 8. Why options distract us from iit main objective

- Studies have shown that When given options, even if we know the expected value of each of these options, we still choose to explore ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 9. The effect of expectations 

- Previously held impressions affect the interpretation 
- If you tell people in advance that something might be distasteful, odds are good that they will agree with you - because of their expectations 

### 10. The power of price

- Price/cost can act as placebo

### 12. Why dealing with cash makes us more honest:

- When the opportunity to cheat is in context of something that‚Äôs a few steps removed, or even one step removed from actual cash, we all cheat, to a greater extent at that
- This is the reason why you see flagrant cheating in insurance claims, backdating stock options, audit books
- In these scenarios, we tend to rationalize and be dishonest by telling ourselves that e we are not being dishonest

### 13. Beer and Free lunches

- When we order out loud in sequence, we tend to order a drink different to what others ordered on table
