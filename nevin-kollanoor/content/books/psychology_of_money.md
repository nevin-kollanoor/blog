### Attitude towards Money:
- An individual's capacity to bear risk depends on his/her personal history
	- People who were born in 1950s have only seen the S&P500 being stagnated during their prime years. While the people born in 1970s have seen it rally. 
	- Their future financial decisions and views are very much dependent on this experience
- If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to be rich than tall
- The line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be just a millimeter thick and only visible through hindsight
- Not all success is due to hardwork and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when you judge people and yourself
- Focus less on specific individuals and more on broad patterns
- The hardest financial skill is to getting the goal post to stop moving
Getting Money:
- Compounding: Ice ages are not caused by cool winters, but rather not hot enough summers, which accumulate over years and cover the entire earth with ice
- The counter intuitiveness of compounding might be responsible for majority of all bad strategies aimed at successful investing
- 91 year old Warren buffet started investing at the age of 11. Of his net worth of 84.5B $, 84.2B $ came after his 50th birthday and 81.5B $ came after his 60th birthday
- There are A million ways to get wealthy but only a few ways to stay wealthy
- The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily

### Staying Wealthy:
- Traits required to stay wealthy:
	- Humility: fear that what you made can be taken away from you just as fast
	- Frugality: acceptance that attest some of what you made is attributed to luck
- 4/10 public companies go bankrupt. Tail events drive majority of returns. Invest in portfolios!
- __People like to feel like they are in control__, that they are in the driver's seat. When we get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, it feels like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else even when they might have originality been happy to go along. 
- Aligning money towards the life that let's you do what you want when you want who you want and for as long as you want has incredible returns
- One of the ironies of money: Wealth is what you don't see. Wealth is the expensive car not bought. Watches not worn. First class upgrades declined. 
- Way to be rich is to spend money you have and not spend money you don't have. Quickest way to FEEL rich is to spend a lot of money on expensive items
- One of the powerful ways to improve savings isn't to raise income, but to raise humility
- After a certain level of income, savings = income-ego
Deal with Financial Anxiety and manage expectations:
- Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money
- Things that never happened in history, happen all the time.
- Focusing on past history and past patterns may cause two things:
	- Overlooking outlier events that move the needle
	- Misreading the present by looking to the past because the past DOESN’T account for the structural changes that are relevant in today’s world
- “This is not a failure of analysis. It’s a failure of imagination.” It is difficult (takes a special kind of skill) to imagine a future that looks nothing like today or anything we have seen before.
- Look at the down swings in portfolio as the fee for investments with good returns - not as fine
- Thinking market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the mindset that let's you stick around long enough for investing gains to play in your favor
- Pessimism sounds smarter and more plausible. It gains more attention
- Appealing fiction: when you want something to be true, you tend to believe stories that overestimate the odds of that being true

### Author's notes:
- Morgan Housel's notion: "I'm a passive investor who believes in world's ability to generate real economic growth, I'm confident that over the next 30 years growth will accrue to my investments"
- Go out of your way to find humility when things go right and forgiveness and compassion when things go wrong
- Key points:  humility, less ego, wealth vs. riches, financial decisions that offer peace of mind, use the power of time and consistency, accept failure and risk, strive for time freedom, frugality, make saving a core habit, be prepared to pay the price required for successful outcomes, prepare a margin of safety, avoid extremes, define the game you’re playing

### Post script: How Americans Think About Money
- US post WW2 had 16 million (11%) serve during the war. Of which 8m were oversees on Aug'45. Their avg age was 23. Almost all of them came home in few months and are out of uniform
- Concerns:
	- <12k homes per month were built in 1941-45 period. Returning soldiers needed home
	- Many jobs created for war needs like ship building have come to a halt
	- Marriage rates during and post war has spiked. All want to start a family in a new home with a good job right away.
- Full scale depression was predicted for the coming 4 years
- US Fed had reduced interest rates in 1941 to .38%. Although this was done to finance the war, they continued to hold this policy. 3-month treasury yields stayed below 2% till mid 1950s
- Consumption became an explicit economic strategy. Govt encouraged spending. Mortgages were given out with almost no down payment at ow rates. Interest on all loans including Credit card were tax deductible.
- US household debt raised from 25B $ in '45 to 125B $ in '55 to 331$ B in '65
- What worked was that great depression created good productivity in American industries. This enabled them to produce new innovative household items in crazy speed. The jobs created with this were also good jobs.
- Gains are shared more equally. Average wages steadily raised. Gap between rich and poor has narrowed. Everyone started living equally well
- Everything in Finance is in the context of expectations. Expectation in US now is that person in 50th percentile of earning should live a life not too different from a person in 90th percentile
- Recession hit in '73. Story since then is the growth continued, but in an uneven manner, yet people's expectations about lifestyle remained the same
- 2008 recession is a paradigm of this mindset.
- In a world with such sharp inequality, success isn't as meritocratic as it used to be.
